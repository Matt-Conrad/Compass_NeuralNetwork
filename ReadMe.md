# A Compass Should Always Point North

In the CompassImages folder you will see a collection of 16 images. There is an arrow and the letter "N" in each image. The arrow points either up, right, down, or left. Additionally, the placement of "N" is also in those same directions. This image set contains all the possible combinations of the configurations. I wanted to build a neural network that would properly classify images where the arrow was correctly pointing to the "N". The goal for this project was to get familiar with building a neural network in Tensorflow. I used a manually created feature matrix for easy visualization and a basic 2-layer neural network that has been previously used to classify the XOR problem. This project also serves as a starting point for using more complex computer vision techniques to create features. 

### Prerequisites

I'm using the following software in this project:
* Python 3.7.3 
* Matplotlib 3.1.0
* Numpy 1.16.4
* Pandas 0.24.2
* Scikit-Learn 0.21.2
* Tensorflow 1.14.0

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
